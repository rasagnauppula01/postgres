Associations:

In Sequelize, associations define relationships between models in a relational database like PostgreSQL. 
They help in structuring the data efficiently and simplifying queries. 
Sequelize provides several types of associations:

One-to-One (1:1) → hasOne & belongsTo
One-to-Many (1:M) → hasMany & belongsTo
Many-to-Many (M:N) → belongsToMany


1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship
A one-to-one relationship means that a row in one table is associated with exactly one row in another table.

Example: Employee & Profile
Each Employee has one Profile, and each Profile belongs to one Employee.

---------
2. One-to-Many (1:M) Relationship
A one-to-many relationship means that one record in a table is related to multiple records in another table.

Example: Department & Employees
A Department has many Employees.
Each Employee belongs to one Department.

---------
3. Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship
A many-to-many relationship means that multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another table.

Example: Employees & Projects
An Employee can work on multiple Projects.
A Project can have multiple Employees.




A is called the source model and B is called the target model. This terminology is important.

The A.hasOne(B) association means that a One-To-One relationship exists between A and B, with the foreign key being defined in the target model (B).

The A.belongsTo(B) association means that a One-To-One relationship exists between A and B, with the foreign key being defined in the source model (A).

The A.hasMany(B) association means that a One-To-Many relationship exists between A and B, with the foreign key being defined in the target model (B).

These three calls will cause Sequelize to automatically add foreign keys to the appropriate models (unless they are already present).

The A.belongsToMany(B, { through: 'C' }) association means that a Many-To-Many relationship exists between A and B, using table C as junction table, which will have the foreign keys (aId and bId, for example). Sequelize will automatically create this model C (unless it already exists) and define the appropriate foreign keys on it.

Note: In the examples above for belongsToMany, a string ('C') was passed to the through option. In this case, Sequelize automatically generates a model with this name. However, you can also pass a model directly, if you have already defined it.
